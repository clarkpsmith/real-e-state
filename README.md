## Requirements

- Bug fix to login without any issues
    
    I've added an env file that stores the value for the Api Base Url
  please add an .env file at the directory level where the package.json resides and add this line of code to the env file (only putting it here because this is just an assessment, its best practice to not add the .env file to github)
  
  REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:5001/'


- Implement Restful API of "Meeting" in both of server and Client

    implemented, view, add, delete, deleteMany, meetings
